# Experimental Results
A YOLOv8 model was used to perform object detection on a sample road image.
The model successfully detected objects present in the scene, demonstrating
the feasibility of applying deep learning to road condition analysis.

# Analysis and Interpretation
The experiment shows that modern object detection models can be used as a
baseline for road degradation detection. The main limitations of this work
are the use of a small dataset and the lack of task-specific training.
Future work includes training on annotated road degradation datasets and
integrating precise GPS-based localization.
